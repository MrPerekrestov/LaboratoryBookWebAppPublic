# LaboratoryBookWebAppPublic
This project is a continuation of the Laboratory Book(WPF) project. In order to access our samples database from any device I decided to create a web client which looks and feels similary to the windows desktop application including dialog windows, pop-ups and seamless content loading. For this purposes "JQuery UI" JavaScript library was utilized. It has a rich set of controls including dialog window, progress bar and a lot more. Although client side is based on the pure javascript and JQuery, the UI follows a model which is close to SPA. The application compleatly reloads only once after the selection of the laboratory book instance. The web app architecture combines both MVC and Web API models.

You can use login "TestUser" and password "qwert1234" to test the web application. Screenshoots of the working application are given below.

## Highlights
* Plain SQL for interaction with database.
* A lot of pure JavaScript and JQuery.
* "JQuery UI" JavaScript library for dialog windows.
* "JQuery Datatable" javascript library for data visualisation.
* "JQuery Toaster" for snackbars.
* Supports all the features of the desktop laboratory book client.

## Used frameworks and programming languages
C#(ASP.NET core MVC), MySQL, JavaScript(JQuery), HTML, CSS
